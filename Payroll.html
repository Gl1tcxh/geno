            <p class="keepingup"><strong> Up with CPD and Stepping Up Reporting Game:</strong> By tackling CPD-accredited courses head-on, I stay up to date with the latest in accounting, taxes, and financial management. Being proficient in handling complex financial situations, including PAYE/PRSI/USC deductions, is a key strength.

                Starting in January 2024, employers must report non-taxable payments made to employees to Revenue. This electronic reporting must be done before issuing pay checks, separate from regular payroll actions, aligning with PAYE Modernisation requirements.
                
                <strong><br> Up for the New Pension Thing: </strong>The new Auto-Enrolment pension scheme requires payroll systems to handle enrolment and calculate pension contributions. With ERR and Auto-Enrolment making payroll more complex, consider outsourcing these tasks to ensure compliance and efficiency. Our computerized payroll software can handle everything from tax payments to subsistence allowances.</p>
